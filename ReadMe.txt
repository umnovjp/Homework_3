03-Password Generator

This project will be a program that will generate a new password of certain length and include different types of 
characters: upper case, lower case, number and special characters. The work is not finished yet. Button 
is not added. It will be added in HTML. I keep focused on JS at this time. Most prompts are working. Complete 
functionality is not there yet. I struggled with JS. But I will finish soon. 

I would like to thank Jon Lynch for explaining Miniproject during lesson 3.3. I borrowed a lot from his explanation.
