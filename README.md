# Homework_3 JavaScript: Password Generator
This script generates a random password. It starts with a prompt that asks how characters the password should have. It checks if number is between 8 and 128. It follows with a series of prompts asking a user which type of characters it wants to include. Next it generates a password and puts it to webpage. 
If user enters parameters that do not meet requirements, the script shows an alert that program will not run correctly. It does not interrupt the program 

I would like to thank Jon Lynch for explaining Mini-project during lesson 3.3. I borrowed a lot from his explanation.
